This is an optimisation problem based on the Google Books Project: https://books.google.co.uk/intl/EN/googlebooks/about.html. The project encounters a logistical challenge: the optimal way to scan millions of books from tens of thousands of libraries in the case where libraries often have the same books in their catalogues. 

The question introduces the real world terms of the challenge, and asks contestants to solve the problem using an input data structure:  input/input.txt. The input file is a data structure  from where candidate libraries with candidate books can be discerned on a points based basis.  

The input file is used to to produce an output file: output/output.txt. The output file is a data structure from where a points based order of libraries and books to be scanned next can be discerned.
